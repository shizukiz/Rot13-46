# Rot13/46
 
## Description
ROT13/46 is a simple letter substitution encryption technique that replaces each letter in the alphabet with the letter 13 or 46 positions ahead or behind it. It is a variation of the ROT13 (Rotate by 13 places) cipher.

## Origin
The ROT13/46 cipher is derived from the ROT13 cipher, which itself is believed to have originated from Julius Caesar's cipher. The ROT13/46 variant extends the concept by allowing a rotation of 46 positions instead of just 13.

## Usage
ROT13/46 is often used as a simple and lightweight encryption technique for obscuring text. It provides a basic level of confidentiality but is not suitable for secure communications. The primary purpose of ROT13/46 is to obfuscate content for fun, prevent spoilers, or hide information from casual readers.

To use ROT13/46, simply apply the letter substitution algorithm to your text. Each letter is replaced by the letter that is 13 or 46 positions ahead or behind it in the alphabet. Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.

Here's an example:

```plaintext
Original text: Hello, World!
ROT13/46 encrypted: Uryyb, Jbeyq!
```

To decrypt the ROT13/46 encrypted text, simply apply the same algorithm again:



```plaintext
ROT13/46 encrypted: Uryyb, Jbeyq!
Decrypted text: Hello, World!
```

Please note that ROT13/46 is a symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning the same key (rotation value) is used for both encryption and decryption.

## Disclaimer
ROT13/46 is a weak encryption algorithm and should not be relied upon for secure communications or sensitive data protection. It is purely a recreational or obfuscation tool.
